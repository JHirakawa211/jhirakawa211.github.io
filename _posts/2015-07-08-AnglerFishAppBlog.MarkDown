#AnglerFish

##I builded a game app called AnglerFish and I am going to write my impressions on creating the game. 

AnglerFish is a game I made based off FlappyBirds. I added a little twist to the game by making the screen black whenever the fish is not moving. That is why it is called AnglerFish because Anglerfish has the ability to light up its surrounding.
